## Design

The design of Zen Grid is a key part of the user experience, focusing on a clean and minimalist aesthetic.

### Color Scheme

The website utilizes a "Zen Palette", a color scheme built on shades of Bootstrap's neutral grays. This palette, complemented by accent colors for highlights and errors, is designed to minimize visual load and create a calm, focused environment for solving puzzles.

![Color scheme](documentation/images/color-scheme.png)

### Typography

Zen Grid's typography is carefully selected for both readability and style. The body text and numbers use the **Quicksand** font, chosen for its good legibility. This is paired with **Goldman** for the main "Zen Grid" heading, which provides a distinctive, matching aesthetic. The combination of these fonts contributes to the site's modern and clean feel.

![Typography](documentation/images/typography.png)

#### Font sizes

- Base font size formula: `min(100vw รท 29, 100vh รท 42)`
  - Scale text relative to the viewport width (100vw / 29).
  - Scale text relative to the viewport height (100vh / 42).
  - Use the smaller of the two values to keep page and font sizes balanced in both portrait and landscape.
- Main heading: `2.5rem`
- Board tiles and number inputs: `1.25rem`
- Default text: `1rem`

#### Weights
- Main heading: `700`
- Bold text: `600`
- Board tiles and number inputs: `500`
- Default text: `400`

### Imagery
The site's only custom image is a favicon, which also serves as a brand logo in the header. The icon is a simplified representation of a 3x3 Sudoku sector, with numbers placed to signify a correct, incorrect, and pre-filled cells. It is designed with bolder font weight and borders to ensure it remains recognizable even at a small size in a browser tab. This imagery connects the user's browser tab to the website and reinforces the brand's identity.

### Wireframe

The Zen Grid interface was designed with a specific visual blueprint in mind, captured in the wireframes below. These diagrams illustrate the site's modular design and mobile-first approach. By overlaying a grid on the main page layout, the wireframes provide a clear understanding of the site's proportions and how each component fits within the overall page ratio of 29x42. This ensures a consistent and balanced user experience that scales seamlessly across different screen sizes.

![Wireframe](documentation/images/wireframe.webp)

### Features (Design Aspect)

Zen Grid was designed with a modular, mobile-first approach. The layout uses CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure the elements are well-proportioned across different screen sizes. The fluid font-size calculation and use of `rem` units ensure that all text scales gracefully, making the game playable on both mobile devices and larger screens.

- **Header**
  - The prominent heading reinforces the "Zen Grid" brand, accompanied by the favicon icon.

    ![Header section](documentation/images/header.png)

- **Controls Section**
  - This section houses the core game controls in an organized, responsive layout. It includes the mode selection buttons, the errors counter for tracking mistakes, and buttons for restarting the puzzle or accessing the game rules.

    ![Controls section](documentation/images/controls.png)

- **Board**
  - The central element of the page, the Sudoku board, is a grid designed to be easy to read and interact with on any device.

    ![Board section](documentation/images/board.png)

- **Number Inputs**
  - The number input section provides a simple and clear way for users to enter their answers. The numbers are dynamically removed as the player correctly places all instances of that number.

    ![Inputs section](documentation/images/inputs.png)
    ![Inputs section](documentation/images/inputs-with-disabled.png)

- **Copyright Footer**
  - A simple and unobtrusive footer provides a link to the developer's GitHub page and copyright information.
    ![ section](documentation/images/footer.png)

- **Highlights**
  - **Selected Input Number Highlight:** When a number on the input panel is selected, all instances of that number on the board are highlighted. This feature helps players to quickly locate numbers and plan their next moves.

    ![Selected Input Number Highlight](documentation/images/number-highlight.png)

  - **Selected Tile Highlight:** Selecting a tile on the board triggers a visual highlight of its corresponding row, column, and 3x3 sector. This provides clear visual guidance and helps players focus on the related cells.

    ![Selected Tile Highlight](documentation/images/row-col-sector-highlight.png)

- **Alerts and Confirmation Boxes**
  - **Game Rules:** A clear and concise modal that explains the rules of Sudoku to new players.

    ![Game Rules](documentation/images/game-rules.png)

  - **New Game Confirmation:** A confirmation dialog appears when a player attempts to start a new game, preventing the accidental loss of a current game's progress.

    ![New Game Confirmation](documentation/images/new-game.png)

  - **Restart Confirmation:** A simple confirmation box gives the player an opportunity to restart the current puzzle and aim for a better score.

    ![Restart Confirmation](documentation/images/restart.png)

  - **Puzzle Completion:** A personalized alert message congratulates the player on completing the puzzle, with messages that vary depending on the difficulty and number of errors.
